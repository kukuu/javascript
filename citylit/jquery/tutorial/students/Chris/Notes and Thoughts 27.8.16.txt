At the end of last lesson I was given the instructions:

Next task: write a html document with some p, div etc.

Tasks for this personal session:

	1: Familiarize myself with the usage of p, div etc
	2: Research some simple CSS and add it to my test site
	3: Map out what I want my test site to include
	4: Make a shell test site for use next lesson
	
1: HTML Revision

The <p> tag denotes a paragraph
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.


2. CSS Notes

What is CSS?
	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
	CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
	CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
	External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
	
CSS Syntax

A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and declartion block:

Selector		Declaration			Declaration

h1				{color:blue;		font-size:12px;}
				 property value		property   value

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

In the following example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

	p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
	}			

CSS Selectors

The Element Selector

The element selector selects elements based on the element name.

For example, you could select all <p> or <div> tags, see the example above.

The ID Selector

The id selector uses the id attribute of the HTML element to select a specific element.

To select an element with a specific id, write a # followed by the id of the elemtent:

	HTML:
	
	<p id="para1"> blabla </p>
	
	CSS:
	
	#para1 {text-align: center; color: red;}

The class Selector

The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) followed by the name of the class


	HTML:
	
	<h1 class="center">Red and center-aligned heading.</h1>
	
	<p class="center">Red and center-aligned paragraph.</p>
	
	CSS:
	
	.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
	}

You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

In the example below, only <p> elements with class="center" will be center-aligned:

	p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
	}

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

In the example below, the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
	
	Note: A class name cannot start with a number!

Grouping Selectors

If you have elements with the same style definitions, like this:

h1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

h2 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

Could be grouped to minimize the code using commas to separate each selector:

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}


3. Map out my test site

What do I want my blog to reflect about me?

I'd like to gradually create a portfolio of my capabilities and a blog about my experiences.

I'd like the portfolio site to predominantly include well documented projects and code snippets.

These could include:

	Raspberry Pi projects
	Arduino projects
	jQuery examples
	CSS/HTML examples
	Python scripts

Currently I have only followed recepies and I haven't embarked on a project individual enough to warrant documenting / writing in detail about.
I need to change this, getting used to writing, making and documenting will reflect well upon myself.

My interests include:

	Skateboarding
	Basketball
	Real ale
	Cocktails
	Piano
	Film
	Music
	Literature

I could split the blog into sections relating to my hobbies and interests.

I could detail my forray into new programming languages and my attempt to go from no experienece to employed in the UX/UI or QA sector.

List of things to do:

Settle on a final list of headers / sections for my blog site.

Create a shell of the blog, maybe focusing on just one page for now so I can present it in this Thursdays session.
