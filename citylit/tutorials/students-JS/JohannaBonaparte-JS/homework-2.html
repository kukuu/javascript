		In this example there is reshuffling. Orange moves to the first position and Banana to the last. 
		Note when you positioning or adding an element as last item in the array,
		the elements in between to the added reshuffled ones are removed. If the added elements
		are placed following each other then subsequent items in the array will be shown. Again if the added element
		is positioned as last, the element in between the positioned elements will not be shown.
