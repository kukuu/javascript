npm
We recommend using React from npm with a bundler like browserify or webpack. You can use the react and react-dom packages. After installing it using npm install --save react react-dom, you can use:

var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
ReactDOM.render(<App />, ...);
