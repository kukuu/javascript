The For Loop<br />

The For loop is executed till a specified condition returns false. It has basically the same syntax then in other languages. It takes 3 arguments and looks as follows:<br /><br /> 

for (initialization; condition; increment) <br />
{     <br />       
   // statements<br />
}<br /><br /><br />
When the For loop executes, the following occurs:<br />

The initializing expression is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. <br />
The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates.<br /> 
The update expression increment executes. <br />
The statements execute, and control returns to step 2.<br />
The following example generates a multiplication table 2 through 9. Outer loop is responsible for generating a list of dividends, and inner loop will be responsible for generating lists of dividers for each individual number:
